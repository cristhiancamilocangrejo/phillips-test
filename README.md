# Code assignment for Phillips
By: Cristhian Cangrejo S

I have implemented the solution for the assignment based on the next frameworks:

- Spring Boot (JPA, Rest)
- Java 11
- Swagger
- Maven

For testing, I have used:

- SpringBoot test
- Mockito
- JUnit

# Run it!
As, the service is configured with spring boot, there is not dependency needed and just run as (by default 8080 port):

    mvn spring-boot:run
    
If you do not have maven, just run as:    
    
    java -jar <path/to/my/jar> --server.port=8080
